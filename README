avr-vim is a small set of scripts that extracts information from the
avr-libc header files to create a Vim syntax file.

Depending on where your avr-libc include directory is, you may need to
modify the INCLUDES_DIR variable in the Makefile.

make all will generate a new syntax file from the current avr-libc
installation.

The scripts create three AVR-related Vim syntax groups from #defines in
the avr-libc header files:

* AVR_ISR for AVR interrupt vectors linked to the Macro syntax group
* AVR_function for #defines that act like functions linked to the
  Function syntax group
* AVR_define for all other #defines linked to the Define syntax group

Your color scheme will hopefully do something sensible with those, but
you can of course customize the highlight for them yourself.  

To use the avr.vim syntax file, put it in ~/.vim/syntax and load it with
:source or :runtime

To automatically load it when editing C files, create
~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim with the following content:

runtime! syntax/avr.vim

Known deficiencies:

Only #defines are extracted, so actual library functions such as the
standard library _P variant functions are currently missing.

Future improvements:

Break out syntax files for individual parts.  If you use a peripheral
name that is not present for the declared device, the coloring will show
it.
